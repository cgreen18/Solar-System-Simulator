# Solar-System-Simulator
A customizable solar system simulator I made freshman year (2016) for my final project in Intro to Engineering w/ Dr. Hossein Asghari. This project was completely my own creation: my partner dropped the class :(
* Create your own solar system from **scratch**!
* Customize planet radius and spinning speed
* Customize the orbit dimensions and year length
* Create any number of planets
* Zoom in and change simulation speed in real-time

![Example System](https://github.com/cgreen18/Solar-System-Simulator/blob/master/example.gif)

#### How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download "solar-sim.zip"
2. Open in MATLAB and run "Second_Solar_GUI.m"
3. Press "Draw Now" button and the rest is self-explanatory!
4. Have fun!


**P.S.** This code is quite ugly in the written code but it works! Forgive my awful freshman coding style
